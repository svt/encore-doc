== Introduction

WARNING: THIS DOCUMENTATION IS CURRENTLY IN A WORK-IN-PROGRESS STATE FOR AN UPCOMING PROJECT RELEASE.

*This is a living, breathing guide*. If youâ€™d like to contribute,  https://github.com/svt/encore-doc[fork us on GitHub!]

*_What is Encore?_*

*Encore* is a scalable video transcodingfootnote:[Encoding = source file is uncompressed, Transcoding = source file is compressed. The distinction might not matter much, but as the project creators use Encore for transcoding, that is preferred nomenclature] tool, built on Open Source giants like https://www.ffmpeg.org/[FFmpeg] and https://github.com/redisson[Redisson].

*_Why does it exist?_*

*Encore* was created to scale, and somewhat abstract the transcoding _power of FFmpeg_, and to offer a simple solution for Transcoding-as-a-Service.

*_Who is it for?_*

*Encore* is aimed at the advanced technical user that needs a scalable video transcoding tool - for example, as a part of their VOD (Video On Demand) Encoding pipeline.

*_How can you use it?_*

For example, you could deploy a number of *Encore* instances within your existing Kubernetes/Docker/other container solution and let the instances communicate with a Redis cluster as a message broker for handling the Queues, so that you can scale your transcoding to many instances.

*_Features_*

* Scalable, with queuing possibilities
* Profile Configuration
* Possibility to extend FFmpeg functionality
* Tested and tried in production

*_Encore is not_*

* A live/stream transcoder
* Having packager functions (like Shaka, Bento and friends).
* Having a GUI

*_Built with_*

* Kotlin
* Spring Boot
* Gradle
* FFmpeg
* mediainfo
* Redisson
* and many other great projects

WARNING: API, Profile and other formats might change now and then before we reach version 1.0.0 - *Encore* is currently considered beta (but it *is* tried, battle tested and in use in production at SVT)
