== Introduction

IMPORTANT: THIS DOCUMENTATION IS CURRENTLY IN A WORK-IN-PROGRESS STATE FOR AN UPCOMING PROJECT RELEASE.

*This is a living, breathing guide*. If youâ€™d like to contribute,  https://github.com/svt/encore-doc[fork us on GitHub!]

*_What is Encore?_*

*Encore* is a scalable video transcodingfootnote:[Encoding = source file is uncompressed, Transcoding = source file is compressed. The distinction might not matter much in practice, but we prefer to use the term Transcoding in the Encore documentation] tool, built on Open Source giants like https://www.ffmpeg.org/[FFmpeg] and https://github.com/redisson[Redisson].

*_Why does it exist?_*

*Encore* was created to scale, and abstract the transcoding _power of FFmpeg_, and to offer a simple solution for Transcoding - Transcoding-as-a-Service.

See the <<projecthistory>> for more about that.

*_Who is it for?_*

*Encore* is aimed at the advanced technical user that needs a scalable video transcoding tool - for example, as a part of their VOD (Video On Demand) transcoding pipeline.

*_How can you use it?_*

For example, you could deploy a number of *Encore* instances within your existing Kubernetes/Docker/other container solution and let the running instances communicate with a Redis cluster (as a Queue message broker). Every instance can than pick the next job lot, and you can scale your transcoding as needed.

*_Features_*

* Scalable - queuing and concurrency options
* Flexible profile configuration
* Possibility to extend FFmpeg functionality
* Tested and tried in production

*_Encore is not_*

* A live/stream transcoder
* A Video packager (see <<faq>>)
* An GUI application

*_Built with_*

* Kotlin
* Gradle
* Spring Boot
* FFmpeg
* Redisson
* and many other great projects

WARNING: API, Profiles, and other formats will change now and then before we reach version 1.0.0 - *Encore* is currently considered a work-in-progress tool.
It *is* used in daily production though.
