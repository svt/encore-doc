=== Frequently Asked Questions

==== I have great idea/bugfix/improvement Y to Encore, how to go further?

See <<contributorguide, The Contribute section>>

==== Can I write a plugin/extension for doing X in *Encore*?

Currently, there are no extensions interface endpoints, but you could, for example, add transcoding functionality by writing an FFMpeg filter - some examples of how that can done can be found at https://github.com/SVT/ffmpeg-filter-proxy-filters[FFmpeg proxy filters] - have a peek at the https://github.com/svt/homebrew-avtools[SVT Brew AVTools] for how to build an FFmpeg with them.

And of course, open a discussion issue if you have any ideas regarding contributions about extensions to *Encore*.

=== Support

There is *no formal* support - none, nada, nothing - for Encore directly from the main contributors / maintainers - but hey, we *want* people to use and improve the project so here are some suggestions for how you can get help.

*File an Issue on GitHub*

You can always file an issue, ask a question, open a discussion issue, and we will most likely respond when time allows.

*Stack Overflow*

If your question does not contain sensitive information, please ask a question on Stack Overflow and use the tag encore. Maybe some other users will help you.

=== Project History

*_The initiative_*

It was around 2018, and it was time to yet again update the license and the hardware for proprietary non-flexible transcoding solution.
Although that unnamed solution had served us well, we also had a history of less than optimal transcoding, flexibility and support when things went wrong.
Around that period, it happened that, there was the next "Tekniksprint 2017" coming up at the organisation.
A "Tekniksprint" is a "innovate what you want for an entire sprint", which SVT has two times a year.
This time, a small team gathered, with the purpose of seeing how much of a video transcoding solution that could be build in two weeks.
So, with warts, hacks and other shortcuts, we had a fun Sprint and ended up with something <<articles-and-talks, almost usable, see links>>.
And, yes, it even had GUI so that we make it pretty demo friendly.
Although, it  was not very robust, and something to aim to build further upon.

The outcome from this was of course, that by having a Proof-of-Concept project, we now could now walk the long and winding internal organisation road of convincing everyone that we could, and that we should re-write the project seriously - weighting flexibility, features and support in comparison with others.
But, cross-checking all already planned (and let's not even mention the unplanned) projects took us almost *one* year after the initial Encore-Tekniksprint.

*_How we started developing Encore_*

It almost became a meme for us, but in 2019 we wrote ut, tested it, and ran it in production, with so good results that we finally could ditch out proprietary solution.
In fact, it helped us achieve better quality, better flexibility, and saved us much money - the costs for developing the Encore solution was multitudes less than buying just another new stack.
Our video expert now has the ability experiment with new codeds, and encoding features that would be straight impossible had we chosen another solution.

*_How we Open Source:d Encore_*

We always had the intention to Open Source the solution, as we guessed others, mainly Public Broadcast organisations, would have an interest in the product.
So during 2019/20 , with almost every Sprint-period, we tried to have at least a task that was directly prepared with Open Sourcing Encore.
Slow, but determined.
That is all.
From license research, to documentation, to basic code cleanups, to remove the most SVT-specific,s releasing libraries that would make it possible to release the project itself.

And here we are, warts and all, but finally here.

So far, Encore has been a success story for us.
We hope that it can benefit you, and grow to be a really great transcoding solution.
