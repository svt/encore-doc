== The User Guide

This part of the documentation describes suggestions get going with a quick start and installation hints.

=== Installation

At the moment there are no *pre-ready-to-go* installation packages, pods, docker compose, docker Images etc, for *Encore*, but fear not - there are a few possibilities in how to get going. Continue reading!

==== Quickstart

* Encore requires:
** JDK 11 or later
** An available Redis instance (default configuration: locally installed port 6379)
** FFmpeg (we recommend the version present in https://github.com/svt/homebrew-avtools[svt/AVTools] repository, which is what we use in our production environment)

===== Build the project

Run all tests and static analysis using:

[source,bash]
....
$ ./gradlew clean check
....

===== Option: Run a local version with Spring Boot BootRun for a developer live testing/try-out

You can run *Encore* on your local Developer machine for a quick test trial by using a local Developer Application Profile and start up *Encore*:

.In the *Encore* root folder:
[source,bash]
----
foobar@foo:~$ SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=local ./gradlew clean bootRun
----

NOTE: This will use the "src/main/resources/application-local.yml" configuration profile in *Encore*.

===== Option: Create an Encore Docker Image

This quickstart option will show you how to use https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux[Brew] and FFMpeg Docker to run Encore from a Docker Image.

First, you need to create base FFmpeg Docker image - the following skeleton example installs a recent version of FFmpeg, with a few SVT-proxy filters, and mediainfo. Modify it after your needs.

====

.Build and run
.With env variable DOCKER_BASE_IMAGE pointing to your FFmpeg Docker Image
[source,bash]
----
foobar@foo:~$ docker build -t encore-docker --build-arg DOCKER_BASE_IMAGE=<yourdockerbaseimage>. && docker run -e SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE='local' encore-docker
----

Success?? Great - next, go and check out the <<concepts>> or the <<apiendpoints>>.
